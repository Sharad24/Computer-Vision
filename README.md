# FashionMNIST

Partially completed repository for understanding effects on output because of:-
- Addition of different types of layers
- Initializers
- Optimizers and Losses and in which case they are useful
- And New Neural Nets like DENSER where the primary purpose is to better model Neural Networks and not just a task of Computer Vision.
