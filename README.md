Partially completed repository for understanding:- 
* Effects on output in Convolutional Neural Nets because of:-
  - Addition of different types of layers
  - Initializers
  - Optimizers and Losses and in which case they are useful
  - And New Neural Nets like DENSER where the primary purpose is to better model Neural Networks and not just a task of Computer Vision.
