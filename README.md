# Computer Vision

Partially completed repository for understanding:- 
* Effects on output in Convolutional Neural Nets because of:-
  - Addition of different types of layers and exploring the uses of different parameters in them.
  - Initializers
  - Optimizers and Losses and in which case they are useful.
  - Regularisation techniques
  - Exploring Activations
* Understanding and exploring different types of tasks in CV. They include:-
  - Basic Classification
  - Object Recognition and Detection
  - Semantic Segmentation
  - Video Analysis
* Exploring Geometric CV
